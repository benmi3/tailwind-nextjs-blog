Benjamin Jørgensen, originally from Norway, has lived in Japan since 2019, and is currently working there as a software developer.

He will also write more here and add more relevant info as he can!

This is a blog created with Next.js and Tailwind.css, with the main purpose of learning some front-end things. Feel free to go to the repo and add issues on things you recommend me to change, or to fix if something is broken!
