Benjamin Jørgensen, originally from Norway, has lived in Japan since 2019, and is currently working there as a software developer.

My hobbies range from gaming, self-hosting and coding. I my current server setup is now just a simple ubuntu server, but at one point, I used proxmox, splitting the machine into a TrueNas and ubuntu server system. I use a raspberry pi 4 to test smaller things, as well as host pi-hole, and use as smart device on the living-room TV.
