# Why I chose to build out my own blog
I will now go through why I decided to build my own blog, although from a template, instead of choosing an existing amazing tool, like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

## Why start a blog?
In 2023, I quit my job as an electrical engineer, and started to look for a job in the IT industry. Although I have been interested in IT, computers, programming, gaming, ever since I was old enough to play PlayStation 1 at my friends house, I don't have a degree in anything relevant. This makes it difficult to find a new place, when you basically have no education, and all the things you know, is self-taught, but didn't think about adding things to a public GitHub repository as you went.
When I first started looking, I asked a family friend for advice, and he told me that knowledge is of course important, showing that you are engaged in the community is also a great way to show that you care, and is interested. I tried to see if I could find an open-source project I could help out with, but couldn't really find anything that felt right. I manged to get a commit, updating an old link on [awesome-self-hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted), which is a list that I used a lot when starting out with self hosting things, but I haven't been able to do anything more then that.

## Learning to code
Over the years, I tried to learn programming, but never really could focus on one thing long enough, to be able to actually use anything. I tried to use different online programming schools, but always end up getting bored, trying to learn what a string is, or a class. Trying to read it as a manual, before using it. This ended up with giving up many times.
One advice I wish I was told when I first started to learn programming, is that, you should try to build something, anything you want to, and just search around and try to learn the language around your project. This might not be the best way to learn any language deeply, but for me, this is what helped me to learn more.  This way of thinking, is the same way I used to learn human languages, just work through the basics of the basics, then start using it as much as you can, checking things and fixing things as I go.

My second year working in the automation industry, I got the opportunity to do a programming gig. It sounded very hard in the beginning, but just researching as I went I ended up making it. It was a simple GUI app that read an excel file, then edited some data, then wrote it back to the excel file. I used python as the syntax is easy to understand, and relatively portable. This worked as intended, at it gave me the feeling of success that I needed to focus more on learning.

## Why build a blog out of a template
The main reason I decided to build my app out of a template, specificly a [tailwind-nextjs-start-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), is that although maybe building it from the bottom would teach me more, not having that much experience in JS/TS and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), would make it a very slow start.  That's why I would rather build it out from a template, remove things I don't like, and add things that I need, would be enough for me at this time. 

## Conclusion
Learning a new language is difficult, and you need a lot of input and output. Using what you have recently learned is the best way to remember it. At the same time as learning a new language, I will try to better my writing, by writing small blog snippets here and there. Mostly for my self, but if someone wants to read it, everyone is welcome to do so!
